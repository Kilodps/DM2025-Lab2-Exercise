It needs a capable GPU to run models (**at least 4GB VRAM**).\n","\n","You can explore the variety of models available through Ollama here:\n","\n","![pic10.png](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ZvD7_yeSCETl98vXI5zo_TikF6Wpu0-r)\n","\n","### Why Use Code (API) for Data Mining?\n","\n","For data analysis, accessing LLMs programmatically is superior to using web chatbots because it allows for:\n","*   **Automation:** Easily process entire datasets with loops.\n","*   **Structured Output:** Receive data in usable formats like **JSON**, ready for analysis in tools like pandas.\n","*   **Reproducibility:** Ensure consistent results by setting fixed parameters.\n","*   **Privacy:** Maintain data security, especially when running models locally.\n","\n","For the main exercises in this lab, we will use **the Gemini API**. This approach offers several advantages over running local open-source models, such as access to state-of-the-art model performance without needing specialized hardware. While the API has usage limits (rate limits and token quotas), it provides a generous **free tier** that is more than sufficient for our exercises.\n","\n","![pic13.png](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1UGHgSyH2-m2ZdjJXJ39_8RCgZov2z94d)\n","\n","![pic14.png](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1D0Q5KpS5bNIH8er0kb8SWt1nZJhfufWa)\n","\n","### The Gemini API\n","\n","We will primarily use the **Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite** (`gemini-2.5-flash-lite`) model. As shown in the rate limit table, this model is optimized for high-frequency tasks and offers a high request-per-day limit of 1,000, making it ideal for completing the lab exercises without interruption.\n","\n","Students are encouraged to explore other models available through the API but should remain mindful of their respective usage limits. For instance:\n","*   **Gemini 2.5 Pro** is a more powerful model but has a lower daily request limit of 100.\n","*   The **Gemma 3** model available via the API offers an impressive 14,400 requests per day, providing another excellent alternative for experimentation.\n","\n","Please be aware of your usage limits as you work through the exercises to ensure you do not get rate-limited.\n","\n","[Gemini Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)\n","\n","[Gemini Rate Limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits)\n","\n","[Description of Gemini Models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VuFHxTWGzAJI"},"source":["---\n","\n","### Interacting with the Gemini API\n","\n","The code cell below contains the primary function, `prompt_gemini`, that we will use throughout this lab to communicate with the Gemini API. It's designed to be a flexible wrapper that handles the details of sending a request and receiving a response.\n","\n","Before you run the exercises, here are the key things you need to understand in this setup:\n","\n","*   **API Key Configuration**: The script loads your API key from a `.env` file located in the `./config/` directory. **You must create this file and add your API key** like this: `GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`. This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n","\n","*   **Global Settings**: At the top of the script, you can find and modify several important defaults:\n","    *   `MODEL_NAME`: We've set this to `\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"`, but you can easily switch to other models like `\"gemini-2.5-pro\"` to experiment.\n","    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n","    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n","\n","*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n","    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n","    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n","    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n","    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n","\n","In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n","\n","If needed, you can also check some tutorials on how a python function works: [Python Functions Tutorial](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"X8CKxw2IzAJI"},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","from google.colab import userdata\n","from google import genai\n","from google.genai import types\n","\n","\n","# System instruction that can dictate how the model behaves in the output, can be customized as needed\n","SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION = (\n","        \"You are a helpful assistant\"\n","    )\n","\n","# Max amount of tokens that the model can output, the Gemini 2.5 Models have this maximum amount\n","# For other models need to check their documentation\n","MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS = 65535\n","MODEL_NAME = \"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\" #

Instead of being explicitly programmed, ML algorithms use statistical techniques to enable systems to 'learn' from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions without human intervention. \n","\n","\t Types of Machine Learning \n","\n","\t\t Common types include supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error with rewards and penalties). \n","\n","\t Applications \n","\n","\t\t ML is used in a wide range of applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis. \n","\n","Data Centers \n","\n","\t Definition \n","\n","\t\t A data center is a dedicated physical facility that an organization uses to house its critical IT infrastructure, including servers, storage systems, networking equipment, and related components. These facilities are designed to provide a secure, reliable, and controlled environment for computing operations. \n","\n","\t Key Components \n","\n","\t\t Essential components include servers, storage devices, network switches and routers, power supplies (including UPS and generators), cooling systems (HVAC), and physical security measures. \n","\n","\t Purpose \n","\n","\t\t Data centers serve as the central hub for data storage, processing, and management, enabling businesses to run applications, host websites, and manage their digital operations. \n","\n","Large Language Models (LLMs) \n","\n","\t Definition \n","\n","\t\t Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model that are trained on massive amounts of text data. They are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LLMs are characterized by their enormous size (billions or trillions of parameters) and their ability to perform a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. \n","\n","\t Capabilities \n","\n","\t\t LLMs can perform tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, code generation, and creative writing. They learn complex linguistic patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning abilities from their training data. \n","\n","\t Underlying Technology \n","\n","\t\t LLMs are typically built using deep learning architectures, most notably the Transformer architecture, which allows them to process sequential data like text very effectively. \n","\n","Relationship Between Machine Learning, Data Centers, and LLMs \n","\n","\t LLMs as a Product of Machine Learning \n","\n","\t\t LLMs are a sophisticated application and outcome of machine learning research and development.

For \n","example, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \n","diving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \n","this idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \n","discovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \n","themselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \n","This brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \n","during a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \n","uninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \n","travel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \n","black hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \n","planets. \n","Throughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \n","opportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \n","‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \n","feet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \n","that a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \n","increases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \n","seven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \n","At the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \n","tesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \n","which will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know.

‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n"," 'document_id': 'doc_2b256fb0'}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":34}],"source":["import json\n","# We can also observe the structure of the raw extracted data\n","with open(\"./DM2025-Lab2-Exercise/results/info_extractions/review_extraction_example.jsonl\", \"r\") as f:\n","    content_extracted_raw = json.load(f)\n","content_extracted_raw"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":543},"id":"02CfKmLOzAJV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1759994829245,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":60,"user":{"displayName":"Didier Salazar","userId":"00223485238853895516"}},"outputId":"d17fb9b0-71c8-44ed-a313-5e61511319ec"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["<style>\n",".lx-highlight { position: relative;

the exercise is now considered a bonus section, not counted for the main grade.`\n","\n","RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n","\n","In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n","\n","In this example we use the library langchain, for documentation on more functions of the library you can check the following link: [LangChain Tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":28,"metadata":{"id":"plDqfOGMzAJa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761291802504,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":19,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Schulz","userId":"04384613179144778331"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n","from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\n","from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma\n","from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings\n","\n","# Function to load, split, and retrieve documents\n","def load_and_retrieve_docs(url):\n","    loader = WebBaseLoader(\n","        web_paths=(url,),\n","        bs_kwargs=dict()\n","    )\n","    docs = loader.load() #We will load the URL that will serve as our data source\n","    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=150) #We will divide the URL in chunks of text for easier comparison in the vector space\n","    splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\n","    #print(splits) #You can print this to see how the chunks in the url where split\n","    embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model=\"models/gemini-embedding-001\")\n","    vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=embeddings) #Our vector space for comparison\n","    return vectorstore.as_retriever()\n","\n","\n","def format_docs(docs):\n","    return \"\\n\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) #Format the retrieved docs in an orderly manner for prompting\n","\n","# Define the Gemini LLM function\n","def gemini_llm(question, context):\n","    system_prompt = \"You are a RAG Agent that needs to provide a well structured answer based on the provided question and context.\"\n","    formatted_prompt = f\"Question: {question}\\n\\nContext: {context}\"\n","    response, logs = prompt_gemini(input_prompt = formatted_prompt, system_instruction = system_prompt, with_tokens_info = True)\n","    print(f\"logs: \\n{logs}\")\n","    # print(f\"Retrieved context: \\n{context}\\n\\n\") # You can print this to observe the retrieved context\n","    return response\n","\n","\n","# Define the RAG chain\n","def rag_chain(question, retriever):\n","    retrieved_docs = retriever.invoke(question)\n","    formatted_context = format_docs(retrieved_docs)\n","    return gemini_llm(question, formatted_context)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Setting the USER_AGENT environment variable for temporal use and also the api key as authentication\n","import os\n","\n","os.environ['USER_AGENT'] = 'RAGTest/1.0; dan.schov@googlemail.com'\n","os.environ['GOOGLE_AUTHENTICATION_TYPE'] = 'api_key'"],"metadata":{"id":"YdjzjnLpKxxS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761291944435,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Schulz","userId":"04384613179144778331"}}},"execution_count":30,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":32,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"q90Ws7aAzAJa","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1761292107141,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":7254,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Schulz","userId":"04384613179144778331"}},"outputId":"7ba53ff4-55b0-4089-c32c-fe7952356ef8"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["ERROR:grpc._plugin_wrapping:AuthMetadataPluginCallback \"<google.auth.transport.grpc.AuthMetadataPlugin object at 0x7e9e615a35c0>\" raised exception!\n","Traceback (most recent call last):\n","  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/google/auth/compute_engine/credentials.py\", line 126, in refresh\n","    self._retrieve_info(request)\n","  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/google/auth/compute_engine/credentials.py\", line 99, in _retrieve_info\n","    info = _metadata.get_service_account_info(\n","           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n","  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/google/auth/compute_engine/_metadata.py\", line 338, in get_service_account_info\n","    return get(request, path, params={\"recursive\": \"true\"})\n","           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n","  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/google/auth/compute_engine/_metadata.py\", line 263, in get\n","    raise exceptions.TransportError(\n","google.auth.exceptions.TransportError: (\"Failed to retrieve http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/?recursive=true from the Google Compute Engine metadata service.

This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n","\n","In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n","\n","*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n","*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n","*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n","\n","To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n","\n","1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n","2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n","\n","We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n","\n","**Prompt Structure:**\n","`System Instruction -> Task Description -> Examples (if not zero-shot) -> Text to Classify`\n","\n","\n","<span style=\"color:green\">For the exercises in this section there is no need to re-run the cells, you can use the data that has been saved previously to the corresponding directory.</span>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"n-BgECWozAJc"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Funciton for visualizing confusion_matrix\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import numpy as np\n","import itertools\n","\n","def plot_confusion_matrix(cm, classes, title='Confusion matrix',\n","                          cmap=sns.cubehelix_palette(as_cmap=True)):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    This function is modified from:\n","    http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_confusion_matrix.html\n","    \"\"\"\n","    classes.sort()\n","    tick_marks = np.arange(len(classes))\n","\n","    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5,5))\n","    im = ax.imshow(cm, interpolation='nearest', cmap=cmap)\n","    ax.figure.colorbar(im, ax=ax)\n","    ax.set(xticks=np.arange(cm.shape[1]),\n","           yticks=np.arange(cm.shape[0]),\n","           xticklabels = classes,\n","           yticklabels = classes,\n","           title = title,\n","           xlabel = 'Predicted label',\n","           ylabel = 'True label')\n","\n","    fmt = 'd'\n","    thresh = cm.max() / 2.\n","    for i, j in itertools.product(range(cm.shape[0]), range(cm.shape[1])):\n","        plt.text(j, i, format(cm[i, j], fmt), horizontalalignment=\"center\", color=\"white\" if cm[i, j] > thresh else \"black\")\n","    ylim_top = len(classes) - 0.5\n","    plt.ylim([ylim_top, -.5])\n","    plt.tight_layout()\n","    plt.show()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"NwfGvUv2zAJc"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report\n","import enum\n","import os\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","import json\n","import time\n","# Define the emotion labels\n","emotions = ['anger', 'fear', 'joy', 'sadness']\n","# Define the model to use for few-shot prompting\n","\n","# Schema for the output, the type enum can be used to make a pool of options if what we want is to classify our text selecting only one of them\n","class Emotions(enum.StrEnum):\n","    ANGER = 'anger'\n","    FEAR = 'fear'\n","    JOY = 'joy'\n","    SADNESS = 'sadness'\n","\n","\n","# Function to handle the rate limits of gemini models\n","def handle_rate_limit(request_count, first_request_time, max_calls_per_min):\n","    current_time = time.time()\n","\n","    # Initialize timer on the first request of a new window\n","    if request_count == 0:\n","        first_request_time = current_time\n","\n","    request_count += 1\n","\n","    # If the rate limit is reached\n","    if request_count > max_calls_per_min:\n","        elapsed_time = current_time - first_request_time\n","        if elapsed_time < 60:\n","            wait_time = 60 - elapsed_time\n","            print(f\"Rate limit of {max_calls_per_min} requests per minute reached.

It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
